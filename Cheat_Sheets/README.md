#Grades:
1. GitHub: 5/10 This is a start but you haven't answered all of the questions in the assignment make sure you answer question 3 and you also define all of the actions individually.
  - Resubmit: 10/10: Nice work
1. Python Basics: 10/10 Nice job! Next time I would consider adding some more examples too.
