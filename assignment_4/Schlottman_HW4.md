#Assignment Summary=
#This week the basis for analyzing the streamflow data relies on utilizing data in the provided starter python code as well as using numpy arrays rather than relying on lists as was done for the previous assignment. Alongside using python conditional statements, we can utilize any means of return necessary as long as they are returned using the numpy array to calculate the values and perform any mathematical operations in order to form a reasonable estimate for the 1 and 2-week streamflow forecast values representing this week's estimates for the  predicted streamflow (cfs).

#Questions=
1. Provide a summary of the forecast values you picked and why.  Include discussion of the quantitative analysis that lead to your prediction. This can include any analysis you complete but must include at least two histograms and some quantitative discussion of flow quantiles that helped you make your decision.

3. Describe the variable flow_data:
  - What is it?
  - What type of values is is composed of?
  - What is are its dimensions, and total size?

3. How many times was the daily flow greater than your prediction in the month of September (express your answer in terms of the total number of times and as a percentage)?

4. How would your answer to the previous question change if you considered only daily flows in or before 2000? Same question for the flows in or after the year 2010? (again report total number of times and percentage)

5. How does the daily flow generally change from the first half of September to the second?
