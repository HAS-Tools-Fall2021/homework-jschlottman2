# Instructions for running the revised version of the  'Code_Review' assignment are outlined in the text below:

## Refer to these directions to run the 'Schlottman_HW8.py' script while following along with the pseudocode to understand what each section is producing in the final return. Follow directions and make sure to enter answer responses for the Prints, plots, & forecasts in the provided  blank spaces after the italicized headers titled "### *AnswerX:* " ". Good luck!

### **Outline of Code**

### Section 1: Run step_1 in the initial section to import python modules/packages.

### Section 2: Run step_2 to create the pandas_dataframe which calls all necessary variables

### Section 3: Run step_3 to return the "Prints" which display common calculations of the streamflow data which includes 'mean, median, std. deviation, quartiles' to gain a quantitative insight into actual streamflow conditions over time for the site.

### *AnswerPrints:* " "

### Section 4: The 'pandas_dataframe' - referenced variables are called in various conditional statements & functions to create 3 unique plots. (Ensure 'Markdown Image' for "VSCode" or 'markdown-image-assistant' for Atom text editors are installed in order to view plots!).

### *AnswerPlots:* " "

### Section 5: After Running Section 1 through Section 4 you should use the returned plots and values to provide a 1-week and 2-week estimate for the streamflow in cubic feet per second. To do this Simply run Section 5 which will return the discharge values (in cfs).

### *AnswerForecasts:* " "
