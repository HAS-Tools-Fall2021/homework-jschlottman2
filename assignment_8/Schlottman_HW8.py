#Created by Jason Schlottman, utilizes functions and examples similar to those provided in past course assignment codes.
#Date: 10/14/2021

# > Although this .py file provides pseudocode, directions are found in "Forecast_Submisions" directory located in the 'hw-jschlottman2' repo im the main GitHub course shared repository!
# As stated in the 'ReadMe_HW8.md' directions answers to the prompt for 'Prints', 'plots', & forecasts are returned by running their respective sections of code below:


" **Section_1** "
# %%
# Import the necesary python packages/modules.
import os
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


" **Section_2** "
# %%
# Define the correct path & filename to call in the streamflow discharge data.
filename = 'streamflow_week7.txt'
filepath = os.path.join('../data', filename)
print(os.getcwd())
print(filepath)


" **Section_3** "
# %%
#Run conditonal staatements and built-in operations to calculate quantitave analysis of streamflow data.


" **Section_4** "
# %%
# Run the code below to produce 3 seperate and unique plots to gain visual insight into how the streamflow varies over time.


" **Section_5** "
# %%
# Run the following code to produce the 1-week and 2-week streamflow forecast estimates for the streamflow data.
