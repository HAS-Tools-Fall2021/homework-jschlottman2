To make reasonable forecast estimates I made changes to the provided .py starter code and simply added elements to the lists found in the code in order to return values and make comparable estimates for my 1 and 2 week predictions for the forecasting of the stream discharge values in cubic feet per second (cfs).
Note: only the variables: "min,max,mean, std. dev" were calculated for the sake of simplicity.

##Assignment Questions:
#1. flow, year, month and day are all defined as the object type known as a "list"  when referring to the given functions in the provided starter code. The variables are integer data types excluding the flow, which is a float.

#2. According to the python return when entering a conditional I found that the daily flow was greater than my prediction in the month of September
 #Total=

 #Percentage=

#3.
#if we consider only daily flows in or before 2000?

#For the daily flows in or after the year 2010?

#4.  How does the daily flow generally change from the first half of September to the second?
 #The daily flow shifts in a trend when comparing the general flow pattern for the first and second halves of the month of September independently.
