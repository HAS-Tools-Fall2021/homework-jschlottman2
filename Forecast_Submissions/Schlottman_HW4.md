#This week the basis for analyzing the streamflow values relies on utilizing data in the provided python starter code focues on attaining data from the numpy arrays rather than lists like we depended on previously. Alongside conditional statements, we may use any type of mathematical operation as long as it is included in the provided numpy array called "*flow_data*" to calculate the necessary mathematical operations and form reasonable estimates for the 1-week and 2-week forecast values representing our estimates for the flow (cfs).

#Questions:

#1. Provide a summary of the forecast values you picked and why.  Include discussion of the quantitative analysis that lead to your prediction. This can include any analysis you complete but must include at least two histograms and some quantitative discussion of flow quantiles that helped you make your decision.

#2. Describe the variable "*flow_data*":
  -What is it?
  - What type of values is is composed of?
  - What is are its dimensions, and total size?

#3. How many times was the daily flow greater than your prediction in the month of September (express your answer in terms of the total number of times and as a percentage)?

#4. How would your answer to the previous question change if you considered only daily flows in or before 2000? Same question for the flows in or after the year 2010? (again report total number of times and percentage)

#5. How does the daily flow generally change from the first half of September to the second?
